# validate-forced-alignment

This repository provides tools and visualizations for analyzing and validating forced alignment outputs against manual annotations. It is intended to assist researchers working with speech data who want to inspect alignment quality at the word and phone level.

## Features

- Visualize the audio with alignment boundaries with annotated segment labels
- Aggregate and analyze boundary-level deviations
- Identify common sources of alignment errors (e.g., vowel-vowel transitions)
- MATLAB Live Script (`.mlx`) demo included

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/validate-forced-alignment.git
2. Run the `run.m` file and/or walk through `demo.mlx` to see a quick guide. Pdf file is also available [here](demo.pdf).
